# Framingham-heart-analysis
The given dataset is provided by Framingham Heart Study, an organization dedicated to
identifying the common factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease since 1948. It is stored
in the SAS studioâ€™s SASHELP folder, SASHELP.HEART. This dataset has 5209 rows and 17
attributes. We will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on this dataset to have a further
understanding of this dataset. EDA here includes a few different parts, including data category,
descriptive statistics, data visualization, and analysis. Then, we will proceed to data pre-
processing, removing outliers, missing data, incomplete data, and inconsistent data existing in
the dataset.
